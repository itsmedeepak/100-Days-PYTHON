There are several libraries and techniques available in Python for the conversion of Video to Audio. One such library is Movie Editor.

MoviePy can read and write all the most common audio and video formats, including GIF, and runs on Windows/Mac/Linux, with Python 2.7+ and 3 (or only Python 3.4+ from v.1.0)
